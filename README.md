# IOSGameTapJump

I started this project back in 2021. It was my first big project using Unity and C#. I finished the base of the game but lost passion for it mid way through. It is a tap game like Flappy Bird. The concept is to tap to get your character to fly as high as possible while avoiding moving objects. The higher one goes the faster one needs to tap to stay on the screen.
